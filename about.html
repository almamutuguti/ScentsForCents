                <p>
                    My journey with perfumes began when I was just in primary school,
                    I used to talk about perfumes to my peers at school and when I came home from
                    school, I would tell my parents all about it. During long holidays I would take
                    my time and visit malls and browse through shops that sell original perfumes.
                    I would ask the shop stewards about their sources however some would ignore and
                    this would just make me feel discouraged.
                    I thought about how I would easily get access to networks effectively and at the
                    comfort of my home.
                    Whenever I sought for permission to access the internet from my parents or even
                    access the gadgets,
                    I would browse for perfume warehouses and send them emails by the help of my parents.
                    After of doing
                    that, I got responses from several perfumery warehouses.
                    In the long run, I faced challenges like ‚Äúwhich markets should I begin with?
                    Where can I source for
                    funds? How can I ship the products?‚Äù
                    My parents were my main supporters in this. They managed to help me solve my problems. My idea was
                    to target all age groups. My parents contributed financially. I was able to acquire
                    networks from
                    the United States of America and United Kingdom. My parents helped me in making
                    orders and getting
                    access to ship them. I began with just five and I got customers from my parent's
                    friends. I made
                    sales and began shipping in more as time went by. I was able to manage my education
                    in high school
                    and the business. My biggest achievement was that I was able to make sales in
                    Botswana, Uganda and
                    Rwanda through my parent's networks.
                    I realized a challenge ‚ÄúHow can I be boundaryless and 24 by 7?‚Äù So that's when
                    I thought about
                    creating a website that a customer can reach out to Scents for Cents Perfumes from
                    anywhere in the
                    world at any time and get affordable perfumes and colognes. The website is a one
                    stop shop that will
                    provide a customer with an experience of a physical shop but at the comfort of
                    their home. They will
                    interact with me, ask questions and complete a transaction and the product delivered
                    safely in the
                    shortest time possible.
